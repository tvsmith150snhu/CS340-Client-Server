CS 340 README 

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Programs should be kept current to remain at a maintainable state and written in a reusable and modular format.  Maintaining a logical order also makes the program readable and provides a certain flow of data.  Adaptability follows the same premise that maintains the code in a modular and easily updated format to answer the problem or concern of the new project.   

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Computer scientists must first consider the desired outcome or solution to the project or program and determine which tools are needed the most to achieve the end result.  The base or basic tools should be considered at first and the code written to support that basic functionality.  This course taught me to use different base files, such as the CRUD (animailshelter.py) file that was imported into the supporting program (ProjectTwoDashboard.ipynb) to work in a modular fashion when producing code.  Before this course, I worked in one large file to produce code for project.  This modular approach demonstrates a more maintainable method to achieve the goal or solution.   

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists are problem solvers that harness the power of technology to analyze and produce data much faster than humanly possible without computers.  This provides swift and accurate data that propels business and entertainment at a speed not attainable otherwise, resulting in quicker learning and further advancement of our knowledge without being hindered by tedious computations or tasks that may prevent users from moving forward.  Computer scientists have become the backbone of most of the daily things we depend upon, from the cars we drive to our household appliances.  Technology has quickly become a daily component of mankind.
Continuous use of sharing sites like GitHub are paramount to the sharing of data and ideas.  Instead of constantly “reinventing the wheel”, coders and computer scientists may continue to build upon established code to improve and perfect it, customizing it for other projects and preventing lost time.  Sharing amongst computer scientists benefits the entire community and strengthens the technological world.
